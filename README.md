**Authentication through face recognition + image anti spoofing check - using WebRTC and Haar waterfall classifiers (POC)**

phase 1:
assigning user identifier + collecting images
that can classify the identified person

phase 2:
network training by feeding the AI with the images of the right person
identified / classified

phase 3:
recognition of the person

-face detection/recognition is done using Haar waterfall classifiers.

-image spoofing detection is done by asking the user to smile at
random time intervals
